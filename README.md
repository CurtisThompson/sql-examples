## Data
The main data used in this repository relates to animal trades tracked by CITES, and can be obtained from [the CITES website](https://trade.cites.org/en/cites_trade/#). The corresponds to the __cites__ table in the database, which has been prefiltered to only include species in the class "Aves".
